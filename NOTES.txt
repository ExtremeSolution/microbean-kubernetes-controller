A SharedIndexInformer creates a new Indexer.

The Indexer creates a new ThreadSafeStore; you can't change this.

The ThreadSafeStore is paired with user-supplied Indexers.

An Indexers (plural English, singular object) is a map of strings to
indexing functions.

SharedIndexInformer.Run() creates a new DeltaFIFO with the new Indexer
(https://github.com/kubernetes/client-go/blob/master/tools/cache/shared_informer.go#L192).

The Indexer supplied to the new DeltaFIFO functions as its KeyLister
and its KeyGetter.

This means the ThreadSafeStore that is created by the Indexer that
belongs to the SharedIndexInformer is where known objects live.

The HandleDeltas function that the SharedIndexInformer uses to process
things updates the Indexer
(https://github.com/kubernetes/client-go/blob/03bfb9bdcfe5482795b999f39ca3ed9ad42ce5bb/tools/cache/shared_informer.go#L355).

This means that the `ThreadSafeStore` will never be cleaned out.
Specifically, Delete will not be called on it unless there's a
corresponding delete in Kubernetes itself.
